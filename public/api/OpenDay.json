Caroe sought to combine the charm and elegance of his former college (Trinity College, Cambridge) with the picturesque balance of many of the University of Oxford colleges. Building work on the Main Building commenced in 1905 and was completed in many stages, the first in 1909. Money ran short for this project, however, and although the side-wings were completed in the 1960s the planned Great Hall has never been built.\r\n\r\nWater refill locations: \r\n\r\nGround floor - North corridor next to 0.91\r\nGround floor - 0.45 next to sink in PVC suite\r\n1st floor - Opposite Council Chamber by library",

We often get asked about this artwork so here’s a little background on it. The piece is called Three Obliques (Walk-In) and was created by the famed artist Dame Barbara Hepworth in 1968. Only two others exist, one at Chatsworth House, and one in Seattle. It’s an astonishing piece of sculpture and provides a lovely backdrop for our annual graduation photos!\r\n\r\n",

We run a number of professionally-directed ensembles including Symphony Orchestra, Contemporary Music Group, Pop Collective, Jazz Ensemble, Lanyi West African Ensemble, Piano Collaboration, Nogo Abang Gamelan Ensemble, Symphonic Winds, Collegium and Chamber Choir. Places in ensembles are allocated early in the academic year and some are auditioned. Our ensembles regularly perform in Cardiff's leading venues, as well as further afield. Our ensembles have previously undertaken tours throughout Europe, China and Indonesia. In addition to the School ensembles, there is a weekly student-run lunchtime concert series, and our student-led musical societies are extremely active including Big Band Society, Music Society, Operatic and Brass Band Societies to name just a few. Some of these ensembles also run annual tours.",

Caroe sought to combine the charm and elegance of his former college (Trinity College, Cambridge) with the picturesque balance of many of the University of Oxford colleges. Building work on the Main Building commenced in 1905 and was completed in many stages, the first in 1909. Money ran short for this project, however, and although the side-wings were completed in the 1960s the planned Great Hall has never been built.\r\n\r\nWater refill locations: \r\n\r\nGround floor - North corridor next to 0.91\r\nGround floor - 0.45 next to sink in PVC suite\r\n1st floor - Opposite Council Chamber by library",
