## Instructions

This exercise is a quick coding challenge designed to give us an idea of how you approach writing code and solving problems. It is not a test. Therefore, there are no right or wrong answers. 

* This is an open exercise to be completed and submitted **48 hours** before your interview. 
* Once completed, please upload the project to a GitHub repository and email us a public link to the repository and GitHub pages site, with the subject “*Interview Exercise '**Your name**'*”. 
* We don’t specify how much time people spend on this task, but on average, they spend between one and two hours.

Using the [CUOpenDayTest](https://github.com/CardiffUniversityUITGB/CUOpenDayTest) repository as a starting point, you should complete the following assignment. In addition to modifying the existing repository, you should also document the requirements that you would have produced to support the project.

You may utilise AI coding assistants. However, we expect you to be fully capable of demonstrating your understanding of the submitted solution.

## Assignment

You have been assigned to support the Student Recruitment team in enhancing the Open Day website. The current site integrates a comprehensive [data feed](https://cardiffuniversityuitgb.github.io/CUOpenDayTest/api/OpenDay.json) that provides detailed information about the Open Day programme. However, the existing user experience is minimal and lacks many of the features and design elements typically expected from a modern, user-friendly event platform.

The goal of this project is to significantly improve the website’s usability, accessibility, and visual appeal, ensuring it effectively supports prospective students in planning and navigating their Open Day experience.

To complete the assignment, you should:
* Document the assignment requirements.
* Implement the requirements you have identified by modifying the provided repository.

### Client Brief
